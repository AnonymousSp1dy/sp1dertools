# Phishing spoofer only works on Linux
# You have to create a SendGrid account (https://app.sendgrid.com/)
# You have to verify your api key in another python console before you use the phishing tool
# Write the following there:
echo "export SENDGRID_API_KEY='Ypur Key'" > sendgrid.env
echo "sendgrid.env" >> .gitignore
source ./sendgrid.env
pip install sendgrid
